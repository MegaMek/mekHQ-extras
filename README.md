# MekHQ-Extras
Extra resources specifically for MekHQ that are not included in the base releases. These are designed to be largely copy/paste into their given folder, but follow the descriptions for each portion of the contents.

## Force Icons
### MekHQ 0.48 Pack
This pack is made up of the pre-Kailan Pack force icon setup, made by multiple artists over the course of a number of years. It is setup to be copy/pasted into the data/images/forces folder, although there are images (as this keeps the old format and filenames) that will override. I'd personally recommend ignoring any overrites, as the Kailan setup is standardized.
### Mjolnir06 Pack
This pack was made by Mjolnir06, and contains tens of thousands of standard force icons.
This pack is setup to be copy/pasted into the data/images/forces folder.
